# Movie Graphs
Project for my graph mining CSCI 4964, graph of movie actor relationships

data from : kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset


To initiate movie-actor bipartite graph, run the "project.py" file with the variable PICKLEIT = 0

To initiate weighted movie graph, run the 'initializeG' function in the "weighted_graph.py" file AFTER you've initialized and pickled the bipartite graph.

After those graphs are pickled, you can use the rest of the files as you please.
